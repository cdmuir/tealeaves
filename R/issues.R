# Issues

# Is stomatal conductance in umol / (m2 s) or mol / (m2 s)?
# in get_Dx, where does 1.75 exponent come from?
# in get_ps, adjust Goff Gratch equation for different pressures
# pressure dependence of D_h0 and D_w0
# For get_H, do I add upper and lower?
# For get_Tv, where was 0.388 constant come from? Add to constants
# Temperature dependence of t_air?
